This dashboard was created with sample data from a DOST program to visualize important information in a sample QR code marketing campaign in the year 2016 for selling a product. Let's call the product, "PRODUCT X".

The information presented in the dashboard gives an overview of how effective QR codes and different advertisement locations are in directing potential customers to landing pages - pages that lead or guide the potential customers to buy PRODUCT X. The metrics and KPIs here provide an insight on how many people are willing,  knowledgeable, and persuaded to take a snap of the QR code. 


Here are five essential QR code metrics to track:

1. Impressions – Refers to how many times the QR code is viewed in its original placement or medium. Typically, this matches the ad impressions where the QR code is featured.

2. Scans – Represents the count of users who actually scan the QR code with their device, leading them to the landing page or linked content.

3. Scan-through rate – The ratio of scans compared to impressions, showing what percentage of viewers went on to scan the code. 

4. Conversions – Indicates the number of users who proceed to purchase or complete the intended next step, aligning with the marketing objectives.

5. Conversion rate – The percentage of users who complete the desired action after scanning, calculated as actions divided by total scans.
